# C-To-Assembly

**Overview**
In this activity, you will convert a simple application from C++ to assembly code. The coding for this assignment will be performed in Codio. You will then download the file from Codio for submission, along with the completed C++ to Assembly Template Word Document.

**Prompt**
Specifically, you must address the following rubric criteria:

Explain the functionality of the C++ code.
Use the C++ to Assembly Activity Template to complete this step.
The C++ file is located within the Software Reverse Engineering Playground in the Module One file folder in Codio. It is also in the following table:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
     {
 int width=10;
 int height=5;
 int area;
 area = width * height;
 
cout<<endl<< area;
 return 0;
}
  
Convert the C++ file into assembly code.
The C++ file is located within the Software Reverse Engineering Playground in the Module One file folder in Codio.
Align each line of C++ code with the corresponding blocks of assembly code.
Use the C++ to Assembly Activity Template to complete this step.
Explain how the blocks of assembly code perform the same tasks as the C++ code.
Use the C++ to Assembly Activity Template to complete this step.
